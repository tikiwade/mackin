# Getting started with the todo app server

After checking out the server run

### npm install

to install all the node module dependencies

To execute the server tests run 

### npm test

Note that the tests do build on eachother rather than tearing down and building up everytime.

To run the server run

### node app.js

This will run the server locally on port 3004. If you want to run it on another port change line 15 in app.js to the port you would like.
